  <li><strong>Problem</strong> - The most used -- and least understood phrase in business -- is 'innovation to drive change'. While many businesses realize that change is needed, particularly in this economy, they don't always understand that underlying problems are structural in nature and canâ€™t be addressed with conventional thinking, strategies and tactics.  </li>
